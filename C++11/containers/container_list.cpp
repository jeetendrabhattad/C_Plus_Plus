/* Lists are seqeunce containers that allow constant time insert and erase operations
 * anywhere within the sequence.
 * They are implemented as doubly linked list.
 * Similar to forward_list: the main difference being forward_list objects are
 * single linked lists and this can be iterated only forwards.
 * compared to array, vector & deque lists perform generally better in inserting,
 * extracting and moving elements. Hence generally used in sorting algorithms.
 * The main difference between list , forward_lists with other sequences is they
 * lack direct access to the elements by their position.
 *
 * methods :- unique - remove duplicates,
 * merge - merge 2 sorted lists
 * sort - sort elements
 * reverse - reverse the order of elements
 *
